# Mocha Dick

Mocha Dick is the one and only Minecraft whaling mod.  The great world of Mocha Dick is one of the open seas, whales, pirates, and slaves.  Hunt whales for their precious materials.  Process their blubber into oil.  Use the oil for fuel and lubricants for various devices.  Build better boats and harpoons so you can hunt larger and more dangerous whales.

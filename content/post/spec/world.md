### The Fog

Land lovers say the fog is a curse from Mocha Dick.  Sea dogs say it is a test from Davey Jones himself to judge the worthy.  If you want to be a whaler, you'll need to face the fog.  If you are within 30 blocks of an ocean or beach you'll find yourself in a slight fog.  If you are on a beach type biome it thickens into a mild fog and out on the ocean biomes you get the thick nasty.  The ocean waters are murky from the fog as well making it difficult to locate sea creatures without some improved technology.   You've heard of a brave inventor from a nearby province who has crafted a whale oil lamp that pushes back the fog.  If only you had some whale oil....



### The White Whale Dimension

The White Whate Dimension is a dark and dangerous place.  Mocha Dick himself is said to live here.  Players must sail out over an ocean on a trans-dimensionally upgraded boat at sunset and activate a whale bone compass to travel here.  Pirate villagers and slavers can be found and traded with here as well.

### Water World

The Water World is an entirely aquatic world.  Players must have an end game boat with a submarine upgrade attached.

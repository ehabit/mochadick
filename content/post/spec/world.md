### The Fog

Land lovers say the fog is a curse from Mocha Dick to protect the oceans from man.  Sea dogs and pirates say it is a test from Davy Jones himself to judge the worthy.  If you want to be a whaler, you'll need to face the fog.  If you are within 30 steps of an ocean or beach you'll find yourself in a slight fog.  If you are on a beach type biome it thickens into a mild fog and out on the ocean biomes you get the thick nasty.  The ocean waters are murky from the fog as well making it difficult to locate sea creatures without some improved technology.   You've heard of a brave inventor from a nearby province who has crafted a whale oil lamp that pushes back the fog.  If only you had some whale oil....


### Ocean Waters

The waters of the oceans are murky and difficult to explore without the appropriate whale oil light sources.


### The White Whale Dimension

The White Whate Dimension is a dark and dangerous place.  Mocha Dick is said to live there.  Players must sail out over an ocean on a trans-dimensionally upgraded boat at sunset and activate a whale bone compass to travel here.  Pirate villagers and slavers can be found and traded with here as well.  The white whale dimension is deep and dark ocean.  It is said a Kraken lurks in the depths, obedient only to Davy Jones.

### Water World

The Water World is an entirely aquatic world.  Players must have an end game boat with a submarine upgrade attached.
